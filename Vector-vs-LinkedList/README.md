## Overview

Performance comparison of vectors and linkedlists from the Standard Template Library (STL). They are compared with respect to 
execution time and the number of calls to the constructor, copy constructor, and destructor functions. The only condition is 
that the vector and the linked list will keep their nodes sorted.
